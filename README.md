# Home Assistant Blueprints

This is a collection of Home Assistant blueprints that I have created or modified for my own use. They are shared here
in the hope that they may be useful to others.

## Installation

To use these blueprints, you can either copy the YAML code directly into your Home Assistant configuration or import 
them through the Home Assistant UI.

1. Open Home Assistant.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Automations & scenes** > **Blueprints**.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for improvements or new blueprints, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. 
Contributions are welcome - but since this is a personal repository, I cannot promise that things are handled or merged, 
if it doesn't suit my needs.

You are free to use, modify, and distribute these blueprints as you see fit, but please give credit by linking back to
